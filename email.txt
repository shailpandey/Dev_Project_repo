HCL need to ensure that we are sending a tech to Signify locations on the date of delivery of the laptops and desktops, there Is cost involved for us to get technicians sent out to collect the deliveries.

 

We depend on the OVP/ACSL report to see the ETA of when the assets will be delivered to the site to schedule the tech visit. In the cases below as examples what we see is that the assets are not being delivered on the date it was mentioned but on a day before or after the ETA without prior notice to us, which as you can understand is wastage of time, effort and money for us. We would need your help in fixing this issue at the earliest.
